 <title>The YAZ Proxy</title>
  <para>
   The YAZ proxy is a transparent Z39.50-to-Z39.50 gateway.  That is,
   it is a Z39.50 server which has as its back-end a Z39.50 client
   that forwards requests on to another server (known as the
   <firstterm>backend target</firstterm>.)
  </para>
  <para>
   The YAZ Proxy is useful for debugging Z39.50 software, logging
   APDUs, redirecting Z39.50 packages through firewalls, etc.
   Furthermore, it offers facilities that often
   boost performance for connectionless Z39.50 clients such
   as web gateways.
  </para>
  <para>
   Unlike most other server software, the proxy runs single-threaded,
   single-process. Every I/O operation
   is non-blocking so it is very lightweight and extremely fast.
   It does not store any state information on the hard drive,
   except any log files you ask for.
  </para>

  <section id="proxy-example">
   <title>Example: Using the Proxy to Log APDUs</title>
   <para>
    Suppose you use a commercial Z39.50 client for which you do not
    have source code, and it's not behaving how you think it should
    when running against some specific server that you have no control
    over.  One way to diagnose the problem is to find out what packets
    (APDUs) are being sent and received, but not all client
    applications have facilities to do APDU logging.
   </para>
   <para>
    No problem.  Run the proxy on a friendly machine, get it to log
    APDUs, and point the errant client at the proxy instead of
    directly at the server that's causing it problems.
   </para>
   <para>
    Suppose the server is running on <literal>foo.bar.com</literal>,
    port 18398.  Run the proxy on the machine of your choice, say
    <literal>your.company.com</literal> like this:
   </para>
   <screen>
    yaz-proxy -a - -t tcp:foo.bar.com:18398 tcp:@:9000
   </screen>
   <para>
    (The <literal>-a -</literal> option requests APDU logging on
    standard output, <literal>-t tcp:foo.bar.com:18398</literal>
    specifies where the backend target is, and
    <literal>tcp:@:9000</literal> tells the proxy to listen on port
    9000 and accept connections from any machine.)
   </para>
   <para>
    Now change your client application's configuration so that instead
    of connecting to <literal>foo.bar.com</literal> port 18398, it
    connects to <literal>your.company.com</literal> port 9000, and
    start it up.  It will work exactly as usual, but all the packets
    will be sent via the proxy, which will generate a log like this:

  <section id="proxy-target">
   <title>Specifying the Backend Target</title>
   <para>
    When the proxy accepts a Z39.50 client session, it
    determines the backend target by the following rules:
    <orderedlist>
     <listitem>
      <para> If the <literal>InitializeRequest</literal> PDU from the
       client includes an 
       <link linkend="otherinfo-encoding"><literal>otherInfo</literal></link>
       element with OID
       <literal>1.2.840.10003.10.1000.81.1</literal>, then the
       contents of that element specify the target to be used, in the
       usual YAZ address format (typically
       <literal>tcp:<parameter>hostname</parameter>:<parameter>port</parameter></literal>)
       as described in
       <ulink url="http://www.indexdata.dk/yaz/doc/comstack.addresses.php"
	>the Addresses section of the YAZ manual</ulink>.
      </para>
     </listitem>
     <listitem>
      <para> Otherwise, the Proxy uses the default target, if one was
       specified on the command-line with the <literal>-t</literal>
       option.
      </para>
     </listitem>
     <listitem>
      <para> Otherwise, the proxy closes the connection with
       the client.
      </para>
     </listitem>
    </orderedlist>
   </para>
  </section>
  <section id="proxy-keepalive">
   <title>Keep-alive Facility for Stateless Clients</title>
   <para>
    Stateless clients such as web gateways may generate a cookie for a Z39.50
    session which is sent to the proxy as part of PDUs. 
    In this case, the proxy will keep alive its Z39.50 session
    to the backend target even when the connection from the client
    to the proxy is closed. When the client contacts the
    proxy again, and re-issues the same cookie, the proxy reuses the
    Z39.50 connection with the backend target.
   </para>
   <para>
    There is no
    guarantee that the Z39.50 connection to the backend
    target is kept forever: the proxy will shut it down after certain
    idle time.
    So in effect, the connection from the client's
    point of view should be considered stateless, and the keep-alive
    facility should be treated only as a performance booster.
   </para>
   <para>
    Cookies may be passed in an
    <link linkend="otherinfo-encoding"><literal>otherInfo</literal></link>
     element with OID <literal>1.2.840.10003.10.1000.81.2</literal>.
   </para>
  </section>

  <section id="proxy-cache">
   <title>Query Caching</title>
   <para>
    Simple stateless clients often send identical Z39.50 searches
    in a relatively short period of time (e.g. in order to produce a
    results-list page, the next page,
    a single full-record, etc). And for many targets, it's
    much more expensive to produce a new result set than to
    reuse an existing one.
   </para>
   <para>
    The proxy tries to solve that by remembering the last query for each
    backend target, so that if an identical query is received next, it
    is turned into Present Requests rather than new Search Requests.
   </para>
   <note>
    <para>
     In a future we release will will probably allows for
     an arbitrary-sized cache for targets supporting named result sets.
    </para>
   </note>
   <para>
    You can enable/disable query caching using option -o.
   </para>
  </section>

  <section id="proxy-optimizations">
   <title>Other Optimizations</title>
   <para>
    We've had some plans to support caching of result set records,
    but this has not yet been implemented.

  <section id="otherinfo-encoding"><title>Otherinformation Encoding</title>

    The proxy uses the OtherInformation definition to carry
    information about the target address and cookie.

    for proxy target and proxy cookie respectively. The
    integer element <literal>category</literal> is set to 0.
    The value proxy and cookie is stored in element
    <literal>characterInfo</literal> of the <literal>information</literal>
    choice.
