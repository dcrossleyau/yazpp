This is an initial implementation of the ZOOM C++ binding
(http://zoom.z3950.org/bind/cplusplus/) for the Yaz toolkit.
It's a rather obvious thin layer on top of Yaz's ZOOM-C
implementation.

The build environment will no doubt need to be tweaked to fit
in with the way that the rest of Yaz++ is built.

Only one wrinkle, really: we want the ZOOM C++ header file for two
different purposes: one is to function as an interface specification
that can go on the ZOOM web-site, and one is to actually build
against.  The requirements of these two manifestations of the header
file are rather different in that the latter needs to include
implementation details that the former very explicitly does _not_
want.  Accordingly, we automatically generate both versions from a
master copy in which the implementation-dependent lines are preceded
by asterisks(*).  So we have:

	master-header	The master copy, which may be edited.
	interface.h	The read-only, automatically-generated file
			that can be considered a formal specification
			of the ZOOM C++ interface.
	zoom++.h	The read-only, automatically-generated file
			that is actually used in the build process,
			and ought quite possibly to be moved into
			../include/yaz++/zoom.h

Good luck!
