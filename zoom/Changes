Changes between the current version of the C++ binding specification
(http://zoom.z3950.org/bind/cplusplus/zoom-1.0g.hh) and the
specification generated in "interface.h" in this directory (which I
expect to become version 1.3a of the official specification.)

--

Add #include <stddef.h> for size_t.

Add destructor declaration to connection class.

Remove errcode(), errmsg() and addinfo() methods from the connection
and resultSet classes, since exceptions should be used in these
enlightened days.

Rename the record::recordSyntax enumeration to record::syntax, and add
an UNKNOWN element.

Remove "virtual" from all the record class's methods, including its
destructor, since we no longer expect to derive record subclasses
representing records expressed in specific record-syntaxes -- see
section ### of version 1.3 of the ZOOM AAPI.

Remove the nfields() and field() methods from the record class --
see section ### of v1.3 of the AAPI.

Rename the error class to exception, and its subclasses likewise.  I
think that's Telling It Like It Is, and it's certainly more in tune
with the way v1.3 of the AAPI is going.

Add some substance to the exception base class: it can now be created
(with an error-code specified), and the error-code may be both fetched
and rendered as a human-readable string.  This is necessary so that
it's possible to meaningfully catch(exception& e).

Add the missing char *errmsg() method to the systemException and
bib1Exception classes.

Add a new exception subclass, queryException, for reporting malformed
query strings etc.
